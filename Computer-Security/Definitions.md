| Thing                                 | Definition                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vulnerability**                     | A flaw or weakness in a system’s design, implementation or operation that could result in a security breach or a violation of the system's security policy  |
| **Threat**                            | A potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm    |
| **Attack**                            | An assault on system security that derives from an intelligent threat.                                                                                      |
| **Risk**                              | Probability that a particular threat will exploit a vulnerability                                                                                           |
| **Non-repudiation**                   | Service can’t deny a message was sent or received                                                                                                           |
| **Security Mechanisms**               | A mechanism that is designed to detect, prevent, or recover from a security attack (Encryption, digital signatures, access controls, data integrity,.. etc) |
| **Fabrication**                       | Attack on authenticity                                                                                                                                      |
| **Distributed consensus protocol**    | There are n nodes that each have an input value. Some of these nodes are faulty or malicious                                                                |
| **Sybil attack**                      | Sybils are just copies of nodes that can be controlled by an adversary                                                                                      |
| **deterministic**                     | repetitions in message may show in ciphertext, using brute force works on this                                                                              |
| **non-malleable**                     | A cryptosystem where an attacker cannot modify a ciphertext in a way that produces a predictable change in the corresponding plaintext.                     |
| **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)** | a list of the serial numbers of all the certificates revoked by a particular CA, signed by the CA concerned                                                 |
